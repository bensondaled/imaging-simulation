batch_1: varied n_cells, noise magnitude, cell timing offset
batch_2: after fixing a few things, varied neuropil magnitude -- caused arpfit to break down
batch_3: switched to gaussian noise, again varying neuropil magnitude
batch_4: varied the level of gaussian noise
batch_5: varied the timing
batch_6: varied timing in the same way as 5, but changed soma_density_field from 45 to 100
batch_7: varied cell number


to make corrcoef plots:
1. take all input cells, filter for expression >2
2. filter these cells for only those matched, with >20% coverage overlap
3. for each of these, if multiple output cells map onto it, choose one with
highest power as the match
4. with 1 to 1 pairs, calculate corrcoef
5. show one dot for each condition along x axis, with the value being the mean
of the corrcoefs for all cells in that condition that passed these tests
